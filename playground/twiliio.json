You shouldn't have to waste time figuring out where to find what you need\u2014you should be able to focus on building.\n\n## How this helps you moving forward\n\nMost businesses don't start with a fully mapped-out customer engagement strategy. They start with a specific need: send transactional emails, track user behavior, add SMS notifications, verify identities, build an AI assistant.\n\nThe problem with separate websites was that it limited discovery. If you came to SendGrid for email, you might not know Twilio had voice APIs, identity verification, or conversational AI tools that could complement your email strategy. [...] Here's what's moving to Twilio.com:\n\n SendGrid blog \u2192 Twilio Blog\n Segment blog \u2192 Twilio Blog\n SendGrid resources \u2192 Twilio Resource Center\n Segment resources \u2192 Twilio Resource Center\n Product pages \u2192 Twilio Products\n Documentation \u2192 Twilio Docs\n\nOld URLs will redirect automatically, so bookmarks won't break.\n\n### Your products stay exactly the same\n\nThis is a website change, not a product change:\n\n No API modifications \u2014 your code keeps working\n Same pricing \u2014 nothing changes about how you're billed\n Same login flows \u2014 just a new login page design\n Same features \u2014 all existing functionality remains\n\nSendGrid and Segment will continue to operate as they always have. We're consolidating how we present information but not how the products work. [...] We're building a platform that helps modern businesses deliver the kind of frictionless, personalized, intelligent customer experiences that actually matter. This is one step in that direction, and we're glad you're along for the ride.\n\n## Related Posts\n\n Meet the Honorees of Twilio\u2019s AI Startup Searchlight 2025 Award Program\n\n  Frank Yaw-Owusu   Bianca St Louis\n Behind the Builder: Justinus Kho, Staff Product Data Analyst\n\n  Twilio Employer Brand Team\n SIGNAL London 2025 had something for everyone\n\n  Leah Lengel\n\n## Related Resources\n\nTwilio Docs\n\nFrom APIs to SDKs to sample apps\n\nAPI reference documentation, SDKs, helper libraries, quickstarts, and tutorials for your language and platform.

Thank you to every Twilion who participated, and here's to continuing our mission of giving back in meaningful ways throughout the year!\n\n## Related Posts\n\n 2025 Global Impact Week Recap\n\n  Tanise Love\n Behind the Builder: Jairaj Shetty, Software Engineer\n\n  Twilio Employer Brand Team\n Behind the Builder: Khushbu Shaikh, Technical Account Lead\n\n  Twilio Employer Brand Team\n\n## Related Resources\n\nTwilio Docs\n\nFrom APIs to SDKs to sample apps\n\nAPI reference documentation, SDKs, helper libraries, quickstarts, and tutorials for your language and platform.  Resource Center\n\nThe latest ebooks, industry reports, and webinars [...] The week reminded us of the collective difference we are capable of as Twilions. From images of teams working together at local shelters to special moments of mentoring, the week was a powerful reminder of how small acts of kindness and service can add up to something much greater. It was wonderful to see the deep sense of purpose that resonated across teams, with employees united in their desire to contribute to meaningful causes.\n\n## Looking Ahead [...] Global Impact Week has come to a close, and what a week it was! Over 1,000 Twilions from across the globe volunteered a total of 2,581 hours, making a meaningful difference in local communities in 28 cities and virtually. Whether it was mentoring students, supporting animal shelters, or volunteering with environmental organizations, Twilio employees showed up in full force to create positive change. This week not only reflected Twilio\u2019s commitment to giving back but also showcased the passion and energy of our employees who are dedicated to making the world a better place.\n\n## Teams Who Led the Way"

It gave me a deeper sense of how our strategy, mission, and values come to life. The networking conversations, team-building opportunities, and resources I took away from that experience have been key in helping me build a high-performing and unified team as well as contribute to my continued growth.\n\n## Which Twilio Magic value feels like it was written just for you? \ud83e\udde2\n\nHonestly, Twilio Magic values are like Beatles albums \u2014 it\u2019s impossible to pick just one favorite. They're all uniquely wonderful and are massively influential in shaping our culture. But if I had to choose, \u2018We Are Positrons\u2019 captures how I try to lead, work, and show up every day. [...] Best practices, code samples, and inspiration to build communications and digital engagement experiences. [...] Our first volunteering event in Bogot\u00e1 a couple years back made that obvious \u2014 It was during our global support operations leaders' visit. That experience reminded us how powerful we are when we work together, not just in our day-to-day roles, but out in the community too. This philosophy sets the tone for who we are as a company \u2014 and it's become part of our DNA and how we operate.\n\nIn fact, two of us now serve on Twilio\u2019s Colombia Impact Committee \u2014 but in reality, everyone pitches in. That shared commitment has shaped how we think about being a Twilion \u2014 balancing technical excellence with a real sense of purpose and social impact.\n\n## When it comes to remote work, what\u2019s your secret to staying sane, sharp, and sometimes showered? \ud83d\udebf"
