Rather than forcing companies to commit to a single LLM provider, Glean acts as the abstraction layer, allowing enterprises to switch between or combine models as capabilities evolve. Enterprises can\u2019t simply load all their internal data into a model and create a wrapper to sort out the solutions later, says Jain. Jain argues enterprises don\u2019t want to be locked into a single model or productivity suite and would rather opt for a neutral infrastructure layer rather than a vertically integrated assistant.",

Artificial intelligence startup Cohere has told investors that it's seeing momentum with enterprise customers, even as rivals like Google, Anthropic and OpenAI claw for market share. Cohere's investor memo comes after CEO Aidan Gomez said in October that the startup hopes to make its public market debut \"soon.\" He told Bloomberg that he thinks investors would welcome a \"pure play AI investment opportunity.\".

ServiceNow plans to integrate Pyramid\u2019s semantic and modeling capabilities into its Now AI Platform to help enterprise users to move from simple analysis to automated action without toggling between systems or workflows. This integration is a strategic maneuver by ServiceNow to strengthen its hand in large enterprise transformation engagements as competitive pressure mounts from rival SaaS providers, who are also seeking to position their platforms as end-to-end AI operating systems, said Gogia. By embedding enterprise grade analytics and foundations for agentic AI inside its platform, ServiceNow strengthens its wallet share argument and reduces displacement risk,\u201d he added.",
