Trust principles were established by the AICPA in 2016 to evaluate and report on an organization\u2019s relevant controls for information and systems in order to assess their SOC 2 compliance. During a SOC 2 examination, an auditor would then evaluate the suitability of the design and/or operating effectiveness of the system controls intended to meet the criteria for the relevant trust services principles. In that case, a complete set of SOC 2 criteria may consist only of the common criteria, used to test the security trust services principle. The SOC 2 trust principles are security, availability, processing integrity, confidentiality, and privacy. Security is generally the one trust services principle that must be covered in a SOC 2 report.
