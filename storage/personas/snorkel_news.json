For example, your input to the model may look something like this, with the description of each individual product listing slotted between the curly brackets:\n\n`Product Description: \u201c{product_description}\u201d   \n  \nExtract all the phrases from Product Description describing the water, stain, fade, or other resistances that the product has.

This bottleneck left significant revenue on the table and froze their ability to scale. The path to automation was further blocked by severe data imbalances where the critical signals for coverage appeared in only a small fraction of claims, making traditional AI models unreliable.\n\n## The Solution\n\nThe firm engaged Snorkel to co-develop a comprehensive data-centric solution. By combining Snorkel\u2019s team and AI research expertise with internal expert and data scientist collaboration, the firm was able to utilize programmatic data labeling and data-centric error analysis to rapidly correct training data at scale. This foundation enabled the development of distilled specialist models, turning a fragmented manual process into a high-accuracy automated workflow optimized for production.\n\n## The Outcome\n\nWithin 60 days, the team deployed a production-grade model that removed the manual bottleneck. Using a research-led approach the firm improved model performance by more than 20 points and accelerated the time to deliver new models by 3x. This efficiency expanded processing capacity by 67% (from 3,000 to all 5,000 claims), unlocking additional revenue from claims that were unable to be reviewed through manual efforts.\n\n## Ready to get started?\n\nTake the next step and see how you can accelerate AI development by 100x.\n\n[Talk to an expert](/talk-to-an-expert-ai-solutions/)\n\n ",

      "raw_content": "Talk to an expert [...] ## Challenge\n\nAnalysts and investment managers at a global custodial bank spend over 10,000 hours manually reviewing and transcribing 10-Ks as part of their thorough Know Your Customer (KYC) process. Buried within these PDFs is critical customer information that enables the bank to verify a company\u2019s identity, establish a risk profile, and inform multiple business processes.\n\nBecause 10-Ks come in various formats, this bank has hundreds of analysts spending 30\u201390 minutes per doc and processing over 10,000 documents each year. If a critical bit of information is missing or incorrect, analysts have to hunt it down, which lengthens the customer onboarding process and allows competitors to swoop in. [...] ## Extracting information from 10-Ks documents for KYC\n\nFinancial institutions are obligated by government policies to carry out customer due diligence as part of customer onboarding. For example, the U.S. Department of the Treasury Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) requires covered financial institutions to identify and verify the identity of beneficial owners of legal entity customers as one of the measures to comply with Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Anti-Terrorist Financing (ATF) laws and regulations.\n\n## Challenge",

Leadership recognized an opportunity to improve response times and customer experience by using an LLM system to automatically handle a significant portion of support emails\u2014enabling human agents to focus on more complex requests.\n\n## The solution\n\nExperian deployed an Agentic AI solution built on AWS to automate and accelerate customer service. The AI system first redacts PII from the incoming emails and classifies them to ensure they are appropriate to answer. It then uses a version of Meta\u2019s Llama3-8b, fine-tuned with data curated through Snorkel, to generate replies. The system queries the model multiple times with different functional modalities to generate a final draft. A human agent then reviews the message, edits as necessary, and sends the completed message.\n\n## The outcome\n\nExperian has reduced costs and response times while improving customer satisfaction.

It\u2019s mostly math. The neural networks at the core of generative AI are black boxes, but the millions, billions, or trillions of small calculations they perform enable their creations.\n3.

Snorkel Flow is used by Fortune 500 enterprises such as Chubb, BNY Mellon, and several government agencies.\n\n## What is weak supervision and how does weak supervision work?\n\nWeak supervision is an approach to machine learning in which high-level and often noisier sources of supervision are used to create much larger training sets much more quickly than could otherwise be produced by manual supervision (i.e. labeling examples manually, one by one).\n\nIf you have high-level, scalable, but potentially noisy sources of signal, you can combine them using multiple sources of supervision. At Snorkel AI, we use labeling functions to do this. [...] Lastly, Snorkel Flow equips you with ready-made infrastructure for the application of these functions. The platform guides you through the process and supplies integrated model training so that you can loop back and make adjustments yourself to your weak supervision sources as you go.\n\n## Use cases for weak supervision\n\nWeak supervision can be applied to many problems. The Snorkel AI team has applied it to text data (long and short), conversations, time series, PDFs, images, videos, and more. So long as domain-relevant resources exist or labeling heuristics can be described, weak supervision can be applied. Some of the use cases include:\n\nSome of the use cases include:",
