This bottleneck left significant revenue on the table and froze their ability to scale. The path to automation was further blocked by severe data imbalances where the critical signals for coverage appeared in only a small fraction of claims, making traditional AI models unreliable.\n\n## The Solution\n\nThe firm engaged Snorkel to co-develop a comprehensive data-centric solution. By combining Snorkel\u2019s team and AI research expertise with internal expert and data scientist collaboration, the firm was able to utilize programmatic data labeling and data-centric error analysis to rapidly correct training data at scale. This foundation enabled the development of distilled specialist models, turning a fragmented manual process into a high-accuracy automated workflow optimized for production.\n\n## The Outcome\n\nWithin 60 days, the team deployed a production-grade model that removed the manual bottleneck. Using a research-led approach the firm improved model performance by more than 20 points and accelerated the time to deliver new models by 3x. This efficiency expanded processing capacity by 67% (from 3,000 to all 5,000 claims), unlocking additional revenue from claims that were unable to be reviewed through manual efforts.\n\n## Ready to get started?\n\nTake the next step and see how you can accelerate AI development by 100x.\n\n[Talk to an expert](/talk-to-an-expert-ai-solutions/)\n\n ",

Buried within these PDFs is critical customer information that enables the bank to verify a company\u2019s identity, establish a risk profile, and inform multiple business processes.\n\nBecause 10-Ks come in various formats, this bank has hundreds of analysts spending 30\u201390 minutes per doc and processing over 10,000 documents each year. If a critical bit of information is missing or incorrect, analysts have to hunt it down, which lengthens the customer onboarding process and allows competitors to swoop in.",

Leadership recognized an opportunity to improve response times and customer experience by using an LLM system to automatically handle a significant portion of support emails\u2014enabling human agents to focus on more complex requests.\n\n## The solution\n\nExperian deployed an Agentic AI solution built on AWS to automate and accelerate customer service. The AI system first redacts PII from the incoming emails and classifies them to ensure they are appropriate to answer. It then uses a version of Meta\u2019s Llama3-8b, fine-tuned with data curated through Snorkel, to generate replies. The system queries the model multiple times with different functional modalities to generate a final draft. A human agent then reviews the message, edits as necessary, and sends the completed message.\n\n## The outcome\n\nExperian has reduced costs and response times while improving customer satisfaction.

[...] 1. Generative AI mirrors its training data. This allows developers to specialize their generative models, but it also means the models amplify biases in training data.\n2. It\u2019s mostly math. The neural networks at the core of generative AI are black boxes, but the millions, billions, or trillions of small calculations they perform enable their creations.\n3. GenAI is already making people more productive. From AI-aided code to Bing\u2019s ChatGPT-aided search, people are already getting things done faster due to GenAI.\n4. GenAI will only become more prevalent. Nearly half of respondents to a Snorkel poll said they expected their company to use LLMs in production by the end of 2023, and Gartner declared genAI the most transformative tech of the last decade. [...] So, what is generative AI, how does it work and why does it matter? We\u2019ll address all of that in this concise guide. Neither exhaustive nor comprehensive, this guide aims to explain the most important aspects of GenAI that everyone should know in plain and accessible language.\n\nEveryone should be sure to read the Five Takeaways section at the bottom of this post.\n\n## What is generative AI?\n\nPut simply: generative artificial intelligence (AI) is any AI application that creates open-ended output.",

        "raw_content": "### Microsoft\n\nMicrosoft launched its Language Understanding Intelligent Service in 2016. The cloud-based NLP platform enables developers to create and deploy custom NLP models for use in applications. The next year, the company launched Tay, a doomed early public experiment in conversational understanding. More recently, Microsoft has partnered closely with OpenAI and experimented with integrating ChatGPT into the Bing search engine.\n\n## Request a free, custom LLM evaluation from Snorkel AI\n\nTo ship LLMs with confidence, enterprises need custom evaluations that are purpose-built for their domains and use cases. In a unique offer, Snorkel AI will help select organizations with a complimentary LLM evaluation, powered by Snorkel\u2019s programmatic data development technology. [...] ### OpenAI\n\nFounded in 2015, OpenAI conducts cutting-edge research in machine learning, natural language processing, computer vision, and robotics, and shares its findings with the scientific community through publications and open-source software. OpenAI is responsible for debuting GPT-3, DALL-E and ChatGPT. The company has partnered with Microsoft since 2019. In early 2023, Microsoft began integrating ChatGPT into the Bing search engine.\n\n### Cohere [...] ### Content generation (written)\n\nFoundation models can help businesses generate content, such as product descriptions or marketing copy. However, the models may struggle with generating text that could be called \u201ccreative\u201d or that captures the unique voice and tone of the business. Additionally, some generated content may be repetitive or nonsensical.\n\n### Content generation (visual)\n\nMulti-modal foundation models could help businesses\u2014particularly design-focussed businesses\u2014generate rough drafts of visual ideas. While the images created by foundation models may fall short of a business\u2019s high standards, they can serve as a rapid brainstorming tool that allows a human designer to identify the most promising design and create a final version.\n\n### Language translation",

[...] The querying approach allows you to extract information without fine-tuning. Simply formulate your extraction task as a natural language prompt, such as \u201cWho is the following quote attributed to?\u201d Well-crafted prompts will lead to better outcomes, but even a simple command will work much of the time.\n\nFine-tuning is more accurate and consistent but requires more data and computational resources. Querying is more flexible and generalizable but may produce incorrect or incomplete answers. Depending on your task and available resources, you may choose either method or a combination of both.\n\n### Summarization [...] ### Text categorization\n\nLarge language models can help machine learning practitioners categorize text in two main ways\u2014through fine-tuning on a labeled dataset, or through clever prompt programming. If you\u2019re trying to categorize a short piece of text, an approach similar to the in-context learning example shown in the sentiment analysis section above could work. For longer pieces of text, you can feed the LLM the text to categorize, followed by a question such as \u201cWhich of the following categories does the above text most closely resemble: business|sports|news.\u201d\n\n### Text editing",

Among many other potential nuances, an organization might want to ensure a customer-facing chatbot never mentions its competitors\u2014something generic evaluation approaches will miss. Sectors like healthcare or finance demand additional layers of compliance, empathy, and precision in communication that generalized criteria are ill-equipped to address comprehensively. [...] Benchmarks often serve as a starting point\u2014a way to assess whether a model meets basic industry expectations. However, these benchmarks may not correspond directly with a company\u2019s unique needs. To bridge this gap, enterprises must develop bespoke benchmarks for each use case they want to address.\n\n### Off-the-shelf analysis tools\n\nReadily available models can handle some aspects of LLM evaluation that don\u2019t fit into the benchmark format.\n\nHugging Face, for example, hosts many models that can evaluate text for sentiment and toxicity. Data scientists can use models like these to evaluate different foundation models and track how responses from their chosen model change as they fine-tune it or iterate on their prompt templates.

This bottleneck left significant revenue on the table and froze their ability to scale. The path to automation was further blocked by severe data imbalances where the critical signals for coverage appeared in only a small fraction of claims, making traditional AI models unreliable.\n\n## The Solution\n\nThe firm engaged Snorkel to co-develop a comprehensive data-centric solution. By combining Snorkel\u2019s team and AI research expertise with internal expert and data scientist collaboration, the firm was able to utilize programmatic data labeling and data-centric error analysis to rapidly correct training data at scale. This foundation enabled the development of distilled specialist models, turning a fragmented manual process into a high-accuracy automated workflow optimized for production.\n\n## The Outcome\n\nWithin 60 days, the team deployed a production-grade model that removed the manual bottleneck. Using a research-led approach the firm improved model performance by more than 20 points and accelerated the time to deliver new models by 3x. This efficiency expanded processing capacity by 67% (from 3,000 to all 5,000 claims), unlocking additional revenue from claims that were unable to be reviewed through manual efforts.\n\n## Ready to get started?\n\nTake the next step and see how you can accelerate AI development by 100x.\n\n[Talk to an expert](/talk-to-an-expert-ai-solutions/)\n\n ",

Buried within these PDFs is critical customer information that enables the bank to verify a company\u2019s identity, establish a risk profile, and inform multiple business processes.\n\nBecause 10-Ks come in various formats, this bank has hundreds of analysts spending 30\u201390 minutes per doc and processing over 10,000 documents each year. If a critical bit of information is missing or incorrect, analysts have to hunt it down, which lengthens the customer onboarding process and allows competitors to swoop in.",

Leadership recognized an opportunity to improve response times and customer experience by using an LLM system to automatically handle a significant portion of support emails\u2014enabling human agents to focus on more complex requests.\n\n## The solution\n\nExperian deployed an Agentic AI solution built on AWS to automate and accelerate customer service. The AI system first redacts PII from the incoming emails and classifies them to ensure they are appropriate to answer. It then uses a version of Meta\u2019s Llama3-8b, fine-tuned with data curated through Snorkel, to generate replies. The system queries the model multiple times with different functional modalities to generate a final draft. A human agent then reviews the message, edits as necessary, and sends the completed message.\n\n## The outcome\n\nExperian has reduced costs and response times while improving customer satisfaction. A survey found that the project boosted Experian\u2019s Net Promoter Score by 8% while delivering responses in less than three seconds.\n\n## Ready to get started?\n\nTake the next step and see how you can accelerate AI development by 100x.\n\n[Talk to an expert](/talk-to-an-expert-ai-solutions/)\n\n ",

However, the models may struggle with generating text that could be called \u201ccreative\u201d or that captures the unique voice and tone of the business. Additionally, some generated content may be repetitive or nonsensical.\n\n### Content generation (visual)\n\nMulti-modal foundation models could help businesses\u2014particularly design-focussed businesses\u2014generate rough drafts of visual ideas. While the images created by foundation models may fall short of a business\u2019s high standards, they can serve as a rapid brainstorming tool that allows a human designer to identify the most promising design and create a final version.\n\n### Language translation",

[...] The querying approach allows you to extract information without fine-tuning. Simply formulate your extraction task as a natural language prompt, such as \u201cWho is the following quote attributed to?\u201d Well-crafted prompts will lead to better outcomes, but even a simple command will work much of the time.\n\nFine-tuning is more accurate and consistent but requires more data and computational resources. Querying is more flexible and generalizable but may produce incorrect or incomplete answers. Depending on your task and available resources, you may choose either method or a combination of both.\n\n### Summarization [...] ### Text categorization\n\nLarge language models can help machine learning practitioners categorize text in two main ways\u2014through fine-tuning on a labeled dataset, or through clever prompt programming. If you\u2019re trying to categorize a short piece of text, an approach similar to the in-context learning example shown in the sentiment analysis section above could work. For longer pieces of text, you can feed the LLM the text to categorize, followed by a question such as \u201cWhich of the following categories does the above text most closely resemble: business|sports|news.\u201d\n\n### Text editing",

However, these benchmarks may not correspond directly with a company\u2019s unique needs. To bridge this gap, enterprises must develop bespoke benchmarks for each use case they want to address.\n\n### Off-the-shelf analysis tools\n\nReadily available models can handle some aspects of LLM evaluation that don\u2019t fit into the benchmark format.\n\nHugging Face, for example, hosts many models that can evaluate text for sentiment and toxicity.

OpenAI on Thursday announced a new enterprise platform called Frontier, its latest launch as part of its ongoing effort to win more business customers. OpenAI said the platform will make it easier for companies to manage, deploy and build artificial intelligence agents, which are tools that can independently complete tasks on behalf of a user. Last month, OpenAI CFO Sarah Friar told CNBC that enterprise customers account for roughly 40% of OpenAI's business, though she expects that figure to reach closer to 50% by the end of the year. OpenAI's new Frontier platform is \"complementary\" to its existing business offerings, including ChatGPT Enterprise, the company said. Simo said it's simply not possible for OpenAI to \"build every single AI agent that companies need.\". The platform provides agents access to a \"shared business context\" within an organization by connecting siloed internal applications, ticketing tools and data warehouses, OpenAI said.",

This bottleneck left significant revenue on the table and froze their ability to scale. The path to automation was further blocked by severe data imbalances where the critical signals for coverage appeared in only a small fraction of claims, making traditional AI models unreliable.\n\n## The Solution\n\nThe firm engaged Snorkel to co-develop a comprehensive data-centric solution. By combining Snorkel\u2019s team and AI research expertise with internal expert and data scientist collaboration, the firm was able to utilize programmatic data labeling and data-centric error analysis to rapidly correct training data at scale. This foundation enabled the development of distilled specialist models, turning a fragmented manual process into a high-accuracy automated workflow optimized for production.\n\n## The Outcome\n\nWithin 60 days, the team deployed a production-grade model that removed the manual bottleneck. Using a research-led approach the firm improved model performance by more than 20 points and accelerated the time to deliver new models by 3x. This efficiency expanded processing capacity by 67% (from 3,000 to all 5,000 claims), unlocking additional revenue from claims that were unable to be reviewed through manual efforts.\n\n## Ready to get started?\n\nTake the next step and see how you can accelerate AI development by 100x.\n\n[Talk to an expert](/talk-to-an-expert-ai-solutions/)\n\n ",

Buried within these PDFs is critical customer information that enables the bank to verify a company\u2019s identity, establish a risk profile, and inform multiple business processes.\n\nBecause 10-Ks come in various formats, this bank has hundreds of analysts spending 30\u201390 minutes per doc and processing over 10,000 documents each year. If a critical bit of information is missing or incorrect, analysts have to hunt it down, which lengthens the customer onboarding process and allows competitors to swoop in.",

Leadership recognized an opportunity to improve response times and customer experience by using an LLM system to automatically handle a significant portion of support emails\u2014enabling human agents to focus on more complex requests.\n\n## The solution\n\nExperian deployed an Agentic AI solution built on AWS to automate and accelerate customer service. The AI system first redacts PII from the incoming emails and classifies them to ensure they are appropriate to answer. It then uses a version of Meta\u2019s Llama3-8b, fine-tuned with data curated through Snorkel, to generate replies. The system queries the model multiple times with different functional modalities to generate a final draft. A human agent then reviews the message, edits as necessary, and sends the completed message.\n\n## The outcome\n\nExperian has reduced costs and response times while improving customer satisfaction.

Querying is more flexible and generalizable but may produce incorrect or incomplete answers.

If you\u2019re trying to categorize a short piece of text, an approach similar to the in-context learning example shown in the sentiment analysis section above could work. For longer pieces of text, you can feed the LLM the text to categorize, followed by a question such as \u201cWhich of the following categories does the above text most closely resemble: business|sports|news.\u201d\n\n### Text editing",

This bottleneck left significant revenue on the table and froze their ability to scale. The path to automation was further blocked by severe data imbalances where the critical signals for coverage appeared in only a small fraction of claims, making traditional AI models unreliable.\n\n## The Solution\n\nThe firm engaged Snorkel to co-develop a comprehensive data-centric solution. By combining Snorkel\u2019s team and AI research expertise with internal expert and data scientist collaboration, the firm was able to utilize programmatic data labeling and data-centric error analysis to rapidly correct training data at scale. This foundation enabled the development of distilled specialist models, turning a fragmented manual process into a high-accuracy automated workflow optimized for production.\n\n## The Outcome\n\nWithin 60 days, the team deployed a production-grade model that removed the manual bottleneck. Using a research-led approach the firm improved model performance by more than 20 points and accelerated the time to deliver new models by 3x. This efficiency expanded processing capacity by 67% (from 3,000 to all 5,000 claims), unlocking additional revenue from claims that were unable to be reviewed through manual efforts.\n\n## Ready to get started?\n\nTake the next step and see how you can accelerate AI development by 100x.\n\n[Talk to an expert](/talk-to-an-expert-ai-solutions/)\n\n ",

Buried within these PDFs is critical customer information that enables the bank to verify a company\u2019s identity, establish a risk profile, and inform multiple business processes.\n\nBecause 10-Ks come in various formats, this bank has hundreds of analysts spending 30\u201390 minutes per doc and processing over 10,000 documents each year. If a critical bit of information is missing or incorrect, analysts have to hunt it down, which lengthens the customer onboarding process and allows competitors to swoop in.",

Leadership recognized an opportunity to improve response times and customer experience by using an LLM system to automatically handle a significant portion of support emails\u2014enabling human agents to focus on more complex requests.\n\n## The solution\n\nExperian deployed an Agentic AI solution built on AWS to automate and accelerate customer service. The AI system first redacts PII from the incoming emails and classifies them to ensure they are appropriate to answer. It then uses a version of Meta\u2019s Llama3-8b, fine-tuned with data curated through Snorkel, to generate replies. The system queries the model multiple times with different functional modalities to generate a final draft. A human agent then reviews the message, edits as necessary, and sends the completed message.\n\n## The outcome\n\nExperian has reduced costs and response times while improving customer satisfaction.

However, the models may struggle with generating text that could be called \u201ccreative\u201d or that captures the unique voice and tone of the business. Additionally, some generated content may be repetitive or nonsensical.\n\n### Content generation (visual)\n\nMulti-modal foundation models could help businesses\u2014particularly design-focussed businesses\u2014generate rough drafts of visual ideas. While the images created by foundation models may fall short of a business\u2019s high standards, they can serve as a rapid brainstorming tool that allows a human designer to identify the most promising design and create a final version.\n\n### Language translation",

Simply formulate your extraction task as a natural language prompt, such as \u201cWho is the following quote attributed to?\u201d Well-crafted prompts will lead to better outcomes, but even a simple command will work much of the time.\n\nFine-tuning is more accurate and consistent but requires more data and computational resources. Querying is more flexible and generalizable but may produce incorrect or incomplete answers. Depending on your task and available resources, you may choose either method or a combination of both.\n\n### Summarization [...] ### Text categorization\n\nLarge language models can help machine learning practitioners categorize text in two main ways\u2014through fine-tuning on a labeled dataset, or through clever prompt programming. If you\u2019re trying to categorize a short piece of text, an approach similar to the in-context learning example shown in the sentiment analysis section above could work. For longer pieces of text, you can feed the LLM the text to categorize, followed by a question such as \u201cWhich of the following categories does the above text most closely resemble: business|sports|news.\u201d\n\n### Text editing",

The path to automation was further blocked by severe data imbalances where the critical signals for coverage appeared in only a small fraction of claims, making traditional AI models unreliable.\n\n## The Solution\n\nThe firm engaged Snorkel to co-develop a comprehensive data-centric solution. By combining Snorkel\u2019s team and AI research expertise with internal expert and data scientist collaboration, the firm was able to utilize programmatic data labeling and data-centric error analysis to rapidly correct training data at scale. This foundation enabled the development of distilled specialist models, turning a fragmented manual process into a high-accuracy automated workflow optimized for production.\n\n## The Outcome\n\nWithin 60 days, the team deployed a production-grade model that removed the manual bottleneck. Using a research-led approach the firm improved model performance by more than 20 points and accelerated the time to deliver new models by 3x. This efficiency expanded processing capacity by 67% (from 3,000 to all 5,000 claims), unlocking additional revenue from claims that were unable to be reviewed through manual efforts.\n\n## Ready to get started?\n\nTake the next step and see how you can accelerate AI development by 100x.\n\n[Talk to an expert](/talk-to-an-expert-ai-solutions/)\n\n ",

Buried within these PDFs is critical customer information that enables the bank to verify a company\u2019s identity, establish a risk profile, and inform multiple business processes.\n\nBecause 10-Ks come in various formats, this bank has hundreds of analysts spending 30\u201390 minutes per doc and processing over 10,000 documents each year. If a critical bit of information is missing or incorrect, analysts have to hunt it down, which lengthens the customer onboarding process and allows competitors to swoop in.",

Querying is more flexible and generalizable but may produce incorrect or incomplete answers. Depending on your task and available resources, you may choose either method or a combination of both.\n\n### Summarization [...] ### Text categorization\n\nLarge language models can help machine learning practitioners categorize text in two main ways\u2014through fine-tuning on a labeled dataset, or through clever prompt programming. If you\u2019re trying to categorize a short piece of text, an approach similar to the in-context learning example shown in the sentiment analysis section above could work. For longer pieces of text, you can feed the LLM the text to categorize, followed by a question such as \u201cWhich of the following categories does the above text most closely resemble: business|sports|news.\u201d\n\n### Text editing",

        "raw_content": "A customer service AI must not only produce accurate responses but also align with the company\u2019s tone and style guidelines to maintain brand consistency. Among many other potential nuances, an organization might want to ensure a customer-facing chatbot never mentions its competitors\u2014something generic evaluation approaches will miss. Sectors like healthcare or finance demand additional layers of compliance, empathy, and precision in communication that generalized criteria are ill-equipped to address comprehensively. [...] Benchmarks often serve as a starting point\u2014a way to assess whether a model meets basic industry expectations. However, these benchmarks may not correspond directly with a company\u2019s unique needs. To bridge this gap, enterprises must develop bespoke benchmarks for each use case they want to address.\n\n### Off-the-shelf analysis tools\n\nReadily available models can handle some aspects of LLM evaluation that don\u2019t fit into the benchmark format.\n\nHugging Face, for example, hosts many models that can evaluate text for sentiment and toxicity. Data scientists can use models like these to evaluate different foundation models and track how responses from their chosen model change as they fine-tune it or iterate on their prompt templates.

Encouraged by the ROI these early partners got from the Snorkel technology, but realizing how much custom build and development work was still needed each time to deploy it, the core team behind the project \u2014 Alex Ratner, Chris R\u00e9, Paroma Varma, Braden Hancock, and Henry Ehrenberg founded Snorkel AI in 2019. There, they launched Snorkel Flow, the first AI platform that enables enterprises to build, iterate, deploy, and adapt AI applications powered by Snorkel\u2019s programmatic labeling technology. In addition to the financing, the company also announced the launch of Snorkel Application Studio today, a visual builder with templated solutions for common AI use cases which further accelerates the model building process.",

This bottleneck left significant revenue on the table and froze their ability to scale. The path to automation was further blocked by severe data imbalances where the critical signals for coverage appeared in only a small fraction of claims, making traditional AI models unreliable.\n\n## The Solution\n\nThe firm engaged Snorkel to co-develop a comprehensive data-centric solution. By combining Snorkel\u2019s team and AI research expertise with internal expert and data scientist collaboration, the firm was able to utilize programmatic data labeling and data-centric error analysis to rapidly correct training data at scale. This foundation enabled the development of distilled specialist models, turning a fragmented manual process into a high-accuracy automated workflow optimized for production.\n\n## The Outcome\n\nWithin 60 days, the team deployed a production-grade model that removed the manual bottleneck. Using a research-led approach the firm improved model performance by more than 20 points and accelerated the time to deliver new models by 3x. This efficiency expanded processing capacity by 67% (from 3,000 to all 5,000 claims), unlocking additional revenue from claims that were unable to be reviewed through manual efforts.\n\n## Ready to get started?\n\nTake the next step and see how you can accelerate AI development by 100x.\n\n[Talk to an expert](/talk-to-an-expert-ai-solutions/)\n\n ",

Leadership recognized an opportunity to improve response times and customer experience by using an LLM system to automatically handle a significant portion of support emails\u2014enabling human agents to focus on more complex requests.\n\n## The solution\n\nExperian deployed an Agentic AI solution built on AWS to automate and accelerate customer service. The AI system first redacts PII from the incoming emails and classifies them to ensure they are appropriate to answer. It then uses a version of Meta\u2019s Llama3-8b, fine-tuned with data curated through Snorkel, to generate replies. The system queries the model multiple times with different functional modalities to generate a final draft. A human agent then reviews the message, edits as necessary, and sends the completed message.\n\n## The outcome\n\nExperian has reduced costs and response times while improving customer satisfaction.

However, the models may struggle with generating text that could be called \u201ccreative\u201d or that captures the unique voice and tone of the business. Additionally, some generated content may be repetitive or nonsensical.\n\n### Content generation (visual)\n\nMulti-modal foundation models could help businesses\u2014particularly design-focussed businesses\u2014generate rough drafts of visual ideas. While the images created by foundation models may fall short of a business\u2019s high standards, they can serve as a rapid brainstorming tool that allows a human designer to identify the most promising design and create a final version.\n\n### Language translation",

Simply formulate your extraction task as a natural language prompt, such as \u201cWho is the following quote attributed to?\u201d Well-crafted prompts will lead to better outcomes, but even a simple command will work much of the time.\n\nFine-tuning is more accurate and consistent but requires more data and computational resources. Querying is more flexible and generalizable but may produce incorrect or incomplete answers. Depending on your task and available resources, you may choose either method or a combination of both.\n\n### Summarization [...] ### Text categorization\n\nLarge language models can help machine learning practitioners categorize text in two main ways\u2014through fine-tuning on a labeled dataset, or through clever prompt programming. If you\u2019re trying to categorize a short piece of text, an approach similar to the in-context learning example shown in the sentiment analysis section above could work. For longer pieces of text, you can feed the LLM the text to categorize, followed by a question such as \u201cWhich of the following categories does the above text most closely resemble: business|sports|news.\u201d\n\n### Text editing",

OpenAI on Thursday announced a new enterprise platform called Frontier, its latest launch as part of its ongoing effort to win more business customers. OpenAI said the platform will make it easier for companies to manage, deploy and build artificial intelligence agents, which are tools that can independently complete tasks on behalf of a user. Last month, OpenAI CFO Sarah Friar told CNBC that enterprise customers account for roughly 40% of OpenAI's business, though she expects that figure to reach closer to 50% by the end of the year. OpenAI's new Frontier platform is \"complementary\" to its existing business offerings, including ChatGPT Enterprise, the company said. Simo said it's simply not possible for OpenAI to \"build every single AI agent that companies need.\". The platform provides agents access to a \"shared business context\" within an organization by connecting siloed internal applications, ticketing tools and data warehouses, OpenAI said.",

This bottleneck left significant revenue on the table and froze their ability to scale. The path to automation was further blocked by severe data imbalances where the critical signals for coverage appeared in only a small fraction of claims, making traditional AI models unreliable.\n\n## The Solution\n\nThe firm engaged Snorkel to co-develop a comprehensive data-centric solution. By combining Snorkel\u2019s team and AI research expertise with internal expert and data scientist collaboration, the firm was able to utilize programmatic data labeling and data-centric error analysis to rapidly correct training data at scale. This foundation enabled the development of distilled specialist models, turning a fragmented manual process into a high-accuracy automated workflow optimized for production.\n\n## The Outcome\n\nWithin 60 days, the team deployed a production-grade model that removed the manual bottleneck. Using a research-led approach the firm improved model performance by more than 20 points and accelerated the time to deliver new models by 3x. This efficiency expanded processing capacity by 67% (from 3,000 to all 5,000 claims), unlocking additional revenue from claims that were unable to be reviewed through manual efforts.\n\n## Ready to get started?\n\nTake the next step and see how you can accelerate AI development by 100x.\n\n[Talk to an expert](/talk-to-an-expert-ai-solutions/)\n\n ",

Buried within these PDFs is critical customer information that enables the bank to verify a company\u2019s identity, establish a risk profile, and inform multiple business processes.\n\nBecause 10-Ks come in various formats, this bank has hundreds of analysts spending 30\u201390 minutes per doc and processing over 10,000 documents each year. If a critical bit of information is missing or incorrect, analysts have to hunt it down, which lengthens the customer onboarding process and allows competitors to swoop in.",

[...] 1. Generative AI mirrors its training data. This allows developers to specialize their generative models, but it also means the models amplify biases in training data.\n2. It\u2019s mostly math. The neural networks at the core of generative AI are black boxes, but the millions, billions, or trillions of small calculations they perform enable their creations.\n3. GenAI is already making people more productive. From AI-aided code to Bing\u2019s ChatGPT-aided search, people are already getting things done faster due to GenAI.\n4. GenAI will only become more prevalent. Nearly half of respondents to a Snorkel poll said they expected their company to use LLMs in production by the end of 2023, and Gartner declared genAI the most transformative tech of the last decade. [...] So, what is generative AI, how does it work and why does it matter? We\u2019ll address all of that in this concise guide. Neither exhaustive nor comprehensive, this guide aims to explain the most important aspects of GenAI that everyone should know in plain and accessible language.\n\nEveryone should be sure to read the Five Takeaways section at the bottom of this post.\n\n## What is generative AI?\n\nPut simply: generative artificial intelligence (AI) is any AI application that creates open-ended output.",

        "raw_content": "### Microsoft\n\nMicrosoft launched its Language Understanding Intelligent Service in 2016. The cloud-based NLP platform enables developers to create and deploy custom NLP models for use in applications. The next year, the company launched Tay, a doomed early public experiment in conversational understanding. More recently, Microsoft has partnered closely with OpenAI and experimented with integrating ChatGPT into the Bing search engine.\n\n## Request a free, custom LLM evaluation from Snorkel AI\n\nTo ship LLMs with confidence, enterprises need custom evaluations that are purpose-built for their domains and use cases. In a unique offer, Snorkel AI will help select organizations with a complimentary LLM evaluation, powered by Snorkel\u2019s programmatic data development technology. [...] ### OpenAI\n\nFounded in 2015, OpenAI conducts cutting-edge research in machine learning, natural language processing, computer vision, and robotics, and shares its findings with the scientific community through publications and open-source software. OpenAI is responsible for debuting GPT-3, DALL-E and ChatGPT. The company has partnered with Microsoft since 2019. In early 2023, Microsoft began integrating ChatGPT into the Bing search engine.\n\n### Cohere [...] ### Content generation (written)\n\nFoundation models can help businesses generate content, such as product descriptions or marketing copy. However, the models may struggle with generating text that could be called \u201ccreative\u201d or that captures the unique voice and tone of the business. Additionally, some generated content may be repetitive or nonsensical.\n\n### Content generation (visual)\n\nMulti-modal foundation models could help businesses\u2014particularly design-focussed businesses\u2014generate rough drafts of visual ideas. While the images created by foundation models may fall short of a business\u2019s high standards, they can serve as a rapid brainstorming tool that allows a human designer to identify the most promising design and create a final version.\n\n### Language translation",

[...] The querying approach allows you to extract information without fine-tuning. Simply formulate your extraction task as a natural language prompt, such as \u201cWho is the following quote attributed to?\u201d Well-crafted prompts will lead to better outcomes, but even a simple command will work much of the time.\n\nFine-tuning is more accurate and consistent but requires more data and computational resources. Querying is more flexible and generalizable but may produce incorrect or incomplete answers. Depending on your task and available resources, you may choose either method or a combination of both.\n\n### Summarization [...] ### Text categorization\n\nLarge language models can help machine learning practitioners categorize text in two main ways\u2014through fine-tuning on a labeled dataset, or through clever prompt programming. If you\u2019re trying to categorize a short piece of text, an approach similar to the in-context learning example shown in the sentiment analysis section above could work. For longer pieces of text, you can feed the LLM the text to categorize, followed by a question such as \u201cWhich of the following categories does the above text most closely resemble: business|sports|news.\u201d\n\n### Text editing",

Among many other potential nuances, an organization might want to ensure a customer-facing chatbot never mentions its competitors\u2014something generic evaluation approaches will miss. Sectors like healthcare or finance demand additional layers of compliance, empathy, and precision in communication that generalized criteria are ill-equipped to address comprehensively. [...] Benchmarks often serve as a starting point\u2014a way to assess whether a model meets basic industry expectations. However, these benchmarks may not correspond directly with a company\u2019s unique needs. To bridge this gap, enterprises must develop bespoke benchmarks for each use case they want to address.\n\n### Off-the-shelf analysis tools\n\nReadily available models can handle some aspects of LLM evaluation that don\u2019t fit into the benchmark format.\n\nHugging Face, for example, hosts many models that can evaluate text for sentiment and toxicity. Data scientists can use models like these to evaluate different foundation models and track how responses from their chosen model change as they fine-tune it or iterate on their prompt templates.

This bottleneck left significant revenue on the table and froze their ability to scale. The path to automation was further blocked by severe data imbalances where the critical signals for coverage appeared in only a small fraction of claims, making traditional AI models unreliable.\n\n## The Solution\n\nThe firm engaged Snorkel to co-develop a comprehensive data-centric solution. By combining Snorkel\u2019s team and AI research expertise with internal expert and data scientist collaboration, the firm was able to utilize programmatic data labeling and data-centric error analysis to rapidly correct training data at scale. This foundation enabled the development of distilled specialist models, turning a fragmented manual process into a high-accuracy automated workflow optimized for production.\n\n## The Outcome\n\nWithin 60 days, the team deployed a production-grade model that removed the manual bottleneck. Using a research-led approach the firm improved model performance by more than 20 points and accelerated the time to deliver new models by 3x. This efficiency expanded processing capacity by 67% (from 3,000 to all 5,000 claims), unlocking additional revenue from claims that were unable to be reviewed through manual efforts.\n\n## Ready to get started?\n\nTake the next step and see how you can accelerate AI development by 100x.\n\n[Talk to an expert](/talk-to-an-expert-ai-solutions/)\n\n ",

The application, built in just a few weeks, streamlined KYC verification as part of customer onboarding. Snorkel\u2019s experts extracted 50+ attributes from various document formats, such as PDF and Word documents, and adapted the AI applications to changing business requirements or compliance regulations.

Together, this team built a high-quality AI-based solution that saved the bank 10,000+ hours and hundreds of thousands of dollars in costs associated with hand-labeling. [...] ## Challenge\n\nAnalysts and investment managers at a global custodial bank spend over 10,000 hours manually reviewing and transcribing 10-Ks as part of their thorough Know Your Customer (KYC) process. Buried within these PDFs is critical customer information that enables the bank to verify a company\u2019s identity, establish a risk profile, and inform multiple business processes.\n\nBecause 10-Ks come in various formats, this bank has hundreds of analysts spending 30\u201390 minutes per doc and processing over 10,000 documents each year. If a critical bit of information is missing or incorrect, analysts have to hunt it down, which lengthens the customer onboarding process and allows competitors to swoop in.",

The AI system first redacts PII from the incoming emails and classifies them to ensure they are appropriate to answer. It then uses a version of Meta\u2019s Llama3-8b, fine-tuned with data curated through Snorkel, to generate replies. The system queries the model multiple times with different functional modalities to generate a final draft. A human agent then reviews the message, edits as necessary, and sends the completed message.\n\n## The outcome\n\nExperian has reduced costs and response times while improving customer satisfaction. A survey found that the project boosted Experian\u2019s Net Promoter Score by 8% while delivering responses in less than three seconds.\n\n## Ready to get started?\n\nTake the next step and see how you can accelerate AI development by 100x.\n\n[Talk to an expert](/talk-to-an-expert-ai-solutions/)\n\n ",

The cloud-based NLP platform enables developers to create and deploy custom NLP models for use in applications. The next year, the company launched Tay, a doomed early public experiment in conversational understanding. More recently, Microsoft has partnered closely with OpenAI and experimented with integrating ChatGPT into the Bing search engine.\n\n## Request a free, custom LLM evaluation from Snorkel AI\n\nTo ship LLMs with confidence, enterprises need custom evaluations that are purpose-built for their domains and use cases. In a unique offer, Snorkel AI will help select organizations with a complimentary LLM evaluation, powered by Snorkel\u2019s programmatic data development technology.

However, the models may struggle with generating text that could be called \u201ccreative\u201d or that captures the unique voice and tone of the business. Additionally, some generated content may be repetitive or nonsensical.\n\n### Content generation (visual)\n\nMulti-modal foundation models could help businesses\u2014particularly design-focussed businesses\u2014generate rough drafts of visual ideas. While the images created by foundation models may fall short of a business\u2019s high standards, they can serve as a rapid brainstorming tool that allows a human designer to identify the most promising design and create a final version.\n\n### Language translation",

The cloud-based NLP platform enables developers to create and deploy custom NLP models for use in applications. The next year, the company launched Tay, a doomed early public experiment in conversational understanding. More recently, Microsoft has partnered closely with OpenAI and experimented with integrating ChatGPT into the Bing search engine.\n\n## Request a free, custom LLM evaluation from Snorkel AI\n\nTo ship LLMs with confidence, enterprises need custom evaluations that are purpose-built for their domains and use cases.

However, the models may struggle with generating text that could be called \u201ccreative\u201d or that captures the unique voice and tone of the business. Additionally, some generated content may be repetitive or nonsensical.\n\n### Content generation (visual)\n\nMulti-modal foundation models could help businesses\u2014particularly design-focussed businesses\u2014generate rough drafts of visual ideas. While the images created by foundation models may fall short of a business\u2019s high standards, they can serve as a rapid brainstorming tool that allows a human designer to identify the most promising design and create a final version.\n\n### Language translation",

Querying is more flexible and generalizable but may produce incorrect or incomplete answers. Depending on your task and available resources, you may choose either method or a combination of both.\n\n### Summarization [...] ### Text categorization\n\nLarge language models can help machine learning practitioners categorize text in two main ways\u2014through fine-tuning on a labeled dataset, or through clever prompt programming. If you\u2019re trying to categorize a short piece of text, an approach similar to the in-context learning example shown in the sentiment analysis section above could work. For longer pieces of text, you can feed the LLM the text to categorize, followed by a question such as \u201cWhich of the following categories does the above text most closely resemble: business|sports|news.\u201d\n\n### Text editing",

Encouraged by the ROI these early partners got from the Snorkel technology, but realizing how much custom build and development work was still needed each time to deploy it, the core team behind the project \u2014 Alex Ratner, Chris R\u00e9, Paroma Varma, Braden Hancock, and Henry Ehrenberg founded Snorkel AI in 2019. There, they launched Snorkel Flow, the first AI platform that enables enterprises to build, iterate, deploy, and adapt AI applications powered by Snorkel\u2019s programmatic labeling technology. In addition to the financing, the company also announced the launch of Snorkel Application Studio today, a visual builder with templated solutions for common AI use cases which further accelerates the model building process.",

This bottleneck left significant revenue on the table and froze their ability to scale. The path to automation was further blocked by severe data imbalances where the critical signals for coverage appeared in only a small fraction of claims, making traditional AI models unreliable.\n\n## The Solution\n\nThe firm engaged Snorkel to co-develop a comprehensive data-centric solution. By combining Snorkel\u2019s team and AI research expertise with internal expert and data scientist collaboration, the firm was able to utilize programmatic data labeling and data-centric error analysis to rapidly correct training data at scale. This foundation enabled the development of distilled specialist models, turning a fragmented manual process into a high-accuracy automated workflow optimized for production.\n\n## The Outcome\n\nWithin 60 days, the team deployed a production-grade model that removed the manual bottleneck. Using a research-led approach the firm improved model performance by more than 20 points and accelerated the time to deliver new models by 3x.

The application, built in just a few weeks, streamlined KYC verification as part of customer onboarding. Snorkel\u2019s experts extracted 50+ attributes from various document formats, such as PDF and Word documents, and adapted the AI applications to changing business requirements or compliance regulations. [...] ## Goal\n\nCreate an adaptable AI application to extract information from industry documents faster by reducing the time and manual effort needed to label a high-quality dataset.  \nSolution\n\n## Solution\n\nSnorkel\u2019s experts used our proprietary technology and worked alongside the bank\u2019s data scientists, data engineers, ML engineers, and SMEs. Together, this team built a high-quality AI-based solution that saved the bank 10,000+ hours and hundreds of thousands of dollars in costs associated with hand-labeling. [...] ## Challenge\n\nAnalysts and investment managers at a global custodial bank spend over 10,000 hours manually reviewing and transcribing 10-Ks as part of their thorough Know Your Customer (KYC) process. Buried within these PDFs is critical customer information that enables the bank to verify a company\u2019s identity, establish a risk profile, and inform multiple business processes.\n\nBecause 10-Ks come in various formats, this bank has hundreds of analysts spending 30\u201390 minutes per doc and processing over 10,000 documents each year. If a critical bit of information is missing or incorrect, analysts have to hunt it down, which lengthens the customer onboarding process and allows competitors to swoop in.",

[...] The querying approach allows you to extract information without fine-tuning. Simply formulate your extraction task as a natural language prompt, such as \u201cWho is the following quote attributed to?\u201d Well-crafted prompts will lead to better outcomes, but even a simple command will work much of the time.\n\nFine-tuning is more accurate and consistent but requires more data and computational resources. Querying is more flexible and generalizable but may produce incorrect or incomplete answers. Depending on your task and available resources, you may choose either method or a combination of both.\n\n### Summarization [...] ### Text categorization\n\nLarge language models can help machine learning practitioners categorize text in two main ways\u2014through fine-tuning on a labeled dataset, or through clever prompt programming. If you\u2019re trying to categorize a short piece of text, an approach similar to the in-context learning example shown in the sentiment analysis section above could work. For longer pieces of text, you can feed the LLM the text to categorize, followed by a question such as \u201cWhich of the following categories does the above text most closely resemble: business|sports|news.\u201d\n\n### Text editing",

This bottleneck left significant revenue on the table and froze their ability to scale. The path to automation was further blocked by severe data imbalances where the critical signals for coverage appeared in only a small fraction of claims, making traditional AI models unreliable.\n\n## The Solution\n\nThe firm engaged Snorkel to co-develop a comprehensive data-centric solution. By combining Snorkel\u2019s team and AI research expertise with internal expert and data scientist collaboration, the firm was able to utilize programmatic data labeling and data-centric error analysis to rapidly correct training data at scale. This foundation enabled the development of distilled specialist models, turning a fragmented manual process into a high-accuracy automated workflow optimized for production.\n\n## The Outcome\n\nWithin 60 days, the team deployed a production-grade model that removed the manual bottleneck. Using a research-led approach the firm improved model performance by more than 20 points and accelerated the time to deliver new models by 3x. This efficiency expanded processing capacity by 67% (from 3,000 to all 5,000 claims), unlocking additional revenue from claims that were unable to be reviewed through manual efforts.\n\n## Ready to get started?\n\nTake the next step and see how you can accelerate AI development by 100x.\n\n[Talk to an expert](/talk-to-an-expert-ai-solutions/)\n\n ",

Buried within these PDFs is critical customer information that enables the bank to verify a company\u2019s identity, establish a risk profile, and inform multiple business processes.\n\nBecause 10-Ks come in various formats, this bank has hundreds of analysts spending 30\u201390 minutes per doc and processing over 10,000 documents each year. If a critical bit of information is missing or incorrect, analysts have to hunt it down, which lengthens the customer onboarding process and allows competitors to swoop in.",

[...] ### OpenAI\n\nFounded in 2015, OpenAI conducts cutting-edge research in machine learning, natural language processing, computer vision, and robotics, and shares its findings with the scientific community through publications and open-source software. OpenAI is responsible for debuting GPT-3, DALL-E and ChatGPT. The company has partnered with Microsoft since 2019. In early 2023, Microsoft began integrating ChatGPT into the Bing search engine.\n\n### Cohere [...] ### Content generation (written)\n\nFoundation models can help businesses generate content, such as product descriptions or marketing copy. However, the models may struggle with generating text that could be called \u201ccreative\u201d or that captures the unique voice and tone of the business. Additionally, some generated content may be repetitive or nonsensical.\n\n### Content generation (visual)\n\nMulti-modal foundation models could help businesses\u2014particularly design-focussed businesses\u2014generate rough drafts of visual ideas. While the images created by foundation models may fall short of a business\u2019s high standards, they can serve as a rapid brainstorming tool that allows a human designer to identify the most promising design and create a final version.\n\n### Language translation",

[...] The querying approach allows you to extract information without fine-tuning. Simply formulate your extraction task as a natural language prompt, such as \u201cWho is the following quote attributed to?\u201d Well-crafted prompts will lead to better outcomes, but even a simple command will work much of the time.\n\nFine-tuning is more accurate and consistent but requires more data and computational resources. Querying is more flexible and generalizable but may produce incorrect or incomplete answers. Depending on your task and available resources, you may choose either method or a combination of both.\n\n### Summarization [...] ### Text categorization\n\nLarge language models can help machine learning practitioners categorize text in two main ways\u2014through fine-tuning on a labeled dataset, or through clever prompt programming. If you\u2019re trying to categorize a short piece of text, an approach similar to the in-context learning example shown in the sentiment analysis section above could work. For longer pieces of text, you can feed the LLM the text to categorize, followed by a question such as \u201cWhich of the following categories does the above text most closely resemble: business|sports|news.\u201d\n\n### Text editing",
