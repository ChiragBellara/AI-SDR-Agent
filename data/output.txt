When you’re talking to a large language model, what exactly is it that you’re talking to?
At Anthropic, we build AI to serve humanity’s long-term well-being.
## ‍
While no one can foresee every outcome AI will have on society, we do know that designing powerful technologies requires both bold steps forward and intentional pauses to consider the effects.
That’s why we focus on building tools with human benefit at their foundation, like Claude. Through our daily research, policy work, and product design, we aim to show what responsible AI development looks like in practice.
